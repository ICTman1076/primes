# ICTman1076/primes

A list of over 2,000,000 primes, with more added by an automated program every
24 hours, hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com). Thanks to them
for not banning me yet!

The most up-to-date version is on
(https://ictman1076.eu.pythonanywhere.com/optimusPrime.txt) but I provided a
mirror here just to make it easier to find.

## WARNING about the difference between this one and the PythonAnywhere one
The Git repo uses new lines (`\n`) to seperate primes, however, the
PythonAnywhere list is formatted in JSON. The reason is because JSON makes life
easier when using the list, whereas using new lines for each prime means within
Git it is easier to see what new prime numbers have been generated when. Some
older commits before [bcabc886](https://gitlab.com/ICTman1076/primes/-/commit/bcabc8866284a9e9a9a867ce887ae199d8a60f5e)
still used JSON, as well, so beware of that.
