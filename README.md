# ICTman1076/primes

A list of over 2,000,000 primes, with more added by an automated program every
24 hours, hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com). Thanks to them
for not banning me yet!

The most up-to-date version is on 
(https://ictman1076.eu.pythonanywhere.com/optimusPrime.txt) but I provided a
mirror here just to make it easier to find.
